S,HasPositiveH1Dimension,"Given an fp-group F and an epimorphism phi of F onto a permutation group H, this intrinsic returns true if some rational representation of H lifts to a rational representation of F whose first cohomology group is non-trivial. By a result of Holt and Plesken this shows that F is infinite. The vararg ESLimit allows the user to place a limit on the dimension of exterior squares for which the Holt-Plesken test will be applied. If DBIrrs is set to true then Magma will use irreducibles for H if available in the Rational Representations Database. If CmpIrrs is set to true then Magma will construct rational irreducible representations for H if they are not present in the database. Setting both false specifies that the test should be applied only to the permutation module and its exterior square. Note that this version is only intended to be called internally. For all other uses the two-argument version should be used",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,303,,0,0,141,,0,0,121,,36,303,-38,-38,-38,-38

S,IsInfiniteFPGroup,"Given a finitely-presented group F, attempt to prove that F is infinite. If successful, the boolean value 'true' is returned together with a text string that outlines a proof of non-finiteness. If the boolean value 'false' is returned, then no conclusion can be drawn. The algorithm used searches for quotient groups and finite-index subgroups and attempts to deduce non-finiteness from these. This version works best for perfect or near perfect groups",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,121,,36,298,-38,-38,-38,-38
