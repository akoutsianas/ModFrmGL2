The Matrix Group Recognition Project README
-------------------------------------------

Algorithms for investigating the structure of matrix groups over
finite fields. The main part consists of code for constructing
composition trees. See recog/README.

Also includes:

Constructive recognition and membership testing of classical groups in
natural representation. See classical/README.

Constructive recognition and membership testing of exceptional groups. 
See exceptional/README.

Aschbacher algorithms, (constructive versions of Aschbacher classes), and
algorithms for SL(2, q) and sporadic groups. See GrpMat/README.

Product replacement Prospector, heuristic for finding random elements
with short SLPs. See GrpMat/prospector/README.
