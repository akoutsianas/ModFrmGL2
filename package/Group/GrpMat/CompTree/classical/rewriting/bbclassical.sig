S,ClassicalRewriteNatural,"G must be a matrix group over a finite field and tr must be an element of the universe of G such that G is equal to a group generated by the output of ClassicalStandardGenerators( type, dim, q )^tr for some values of type, dim, and q. The function returns true and a straight-line program from the generating set of G given by ClassicalStandardGenerators( type, dim, q )^tr to g. The additional parameter type may specify the classical type of G. The use of this parameter is recommended when G may be viewed in more than one way as a classical group (such as SL(2,q)=Sp(2,q)). The possible values for type are ""SL"", ""Sp"", ""SU"", ""Omega"", ""Omega+"", and ""Omega-"". By default, the element g is assumed to be an element of G and no membership test is performed. In this case, the output true should be interpreted as stating that the rewriting process terminated successfully. The optional parameter CheckMembership can be used to force membership test before the rewriting procedure is performed. If this parameter is set true, then the function checks the membership of g in G. If the membership test fails, the function returns false, if the membership test is successful, the function returns true and an SLP to the element g",3,0,1,178,0,84,1,1,180,0,84,2,1,180,0,84,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,180,,0,0,180,,0,0,178,,36,-28,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,ClassicalRewriteNatural,"The function writes an element g of a classical group generated by ClassicalStandardGenerators( type, dim, q )^tr (where dim and q are inferred from g) as a straight-line program in the generators given by ClassicalStandardGenerators( type, dim, q )^tr.

S,ClassicalRewrite,"The group G must be isomorphic to the classical group given by the argument type, dim, and q; gens must be a generating set of G that satisfies ClassicalStandardPresentation( type, dim, q ); g must be an element in the same universe as the generators of G; the string type is one of ""SL"", ""Sp"", ""SU"", ""Omega"", ""Omega+"", ""Omega-"". The function checks if g is an element of G and returns true or false accordingly. Further, if g is in G, then the function also returns a straight-line program from gens to g. The algorithm employed in the function depends on whether G is given in its natural representation, in a matrix representation over a field in the defining characteristic (grey-box), or in some other representation that that does not fall under the previous cases (black-box). The optional parameter Method may be supplied to override the default choice of algorithm. The possible values of Method are ""BB"" (to force that the black-box algorithm be used) or ""CharP"" (to force the grey-box algorithm). If g is not an element of G, then the program attempts to find an SLP that points to an element of h such that gh^-1 centralises G. If such an SLP is found that the function returns false and this SLP",0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-28,,0,0,148,,0,0,148,,0,0,298,,0,0,82,,0,0,-27,,36,-28,-38,-38,-38,-38
